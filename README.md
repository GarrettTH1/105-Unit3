This repository contains datasets and a Jupyter Notebook used for an english project.

The 2014-2015 County Public Health dataset was provided for the assignment and contains a wealth of data about a number of public health factors from counties all across the country.

The second dataset with compiled at the end is a subset of the original dataset created using two major processes

1. The dataset was cut to include only data from North Carolina
2. The around 60 columns of data were reduced to around 15 columns. Mostly related to measures of mental and physical health, insurance, income, and exercise.

The .ipynb Jupyter Notebook simply contains the code used to create the subset from the original dataset.


This compiled dataset should offer relatively easy ways to analyze health issues and their causes in North Carolina.
